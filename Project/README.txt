## Secret note to teacher

*   Why am I wrighting this? Because I do not wanna leave this school because 
    of my situation, even thought it was my fault. 
    I am having a lot of issues with mental health and self doubt, so I have prokrastinated a lot,
    and I have missed lots of lessons, due to illness, or that I was in different country. 
    In any case I really wanna study in this school, and I am ready 
    to do everything in my power to do so. Please concider it as an note 
    (and as a little appology, that I am even troubleing you with this 'stuff'), 
    that I will do my work, in order to normalize my stydying "situation".
